Here I implement the project from the brilliant "Nand to Tetris" courses (Part 1 and 2).
Part 1: https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer
Part 2: https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2

I started from building the basic building blocks of the hack computer, starting from a single NAND gate. From there I had to build a simple assembler and compiler for the "classroom language" JACK.
Overall this is a brilliant course and it has really helped me translate what it actually means when computers work with 0's and 1's.
